      <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
      <h3 id="what-data">What are data?</h3>
      <p>Along this document, we consider data being any kind of content produced by a person and disposed on the Web. It could be photographs, drawings, text, code, etc. We also include the enriched data. When data are put online, they will be enriched through human or automatic interactions (example: tagging on photographs). These enriched data are part of the personal data value, which is worth keeping in the longterm.</p>
      <h3 id="what-services">What are services?</h3>
      <p>Services could be a simple blog, a social network, an online simple backup system, a messenger communication tool, etc. Some of these services are accessed through a browser, some through specific clients or Web applications. Many users are also unaware of what is done with their data and how some different online services belong to some unique data aggregator companies.</p>
      <h3 id="data-context">Data Sharing Contexts</h3>
      <p>Using services and exposing data comes in many different contexts. Some people are using their own computers, some people are sharing a computer at home or in a public space such as a classroom or an internet cafe. This creates more challenges for both one's privacy and one's data independence. It is not always possible to save data locally when traveling and accessing or uploading data online.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>one user - one <strong>owned</strong> computer - one browser</li>
      <li>one user - one <strong>owned</strong> computer - multiple browsers</li>
      <li>multiple users - one <strong>shared</strong> computer - one shared browser</li>
      <li>multiple users - multiple <strong>shared</strong> computers - multiple browsers</li>
